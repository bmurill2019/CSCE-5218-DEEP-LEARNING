    "### Question 3\n",
    "Write a couple paragraphs interpreting the results with all the combinations of hyperparameters. Drawing a plot will probably help you make a point. In particular, answer the following:\n",
    "- A. Do you need to train with all the training dataset to get the highest accuracy with the test dataset?\n",
    "- B. How do you justify that training the second run obtains worse accuracy than the first one (despite the second one uses more training data)?\n",
    "```\n",
    "#tr: 100, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.050; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 71.0\n",
    "#tr: 200, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.005; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 68.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- C. Can you get higher accuracy with additional hyperparameters (higher than `80.0`)?\n",
    "- D. Is it always worth training for more epochs (while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO: Add your answer here (code and text)\n",
    "- A. As it can be seen in the iteration\n",
    "    `#tr: 300, epochs: 100, learning rate: 0.010; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 80.0`\n",
    "    it was not needed the whole training dataset to achieve the accuracy of 80.0, this means that it's performance also depends on the values of the hyperparameters (Lr and epochs). it can be also possible that a smaller training set generalizes well the data so the unseen data may have better results.\n",
    "- B. I'd say that the learning rate in the second run is so small that does not allow the model to move a lot in the cost function curve, it means that the steps are small so more epochs are needed to reach the minimum. Whereas the learning rate for the first run was higher, it allows the model to make bigger steps and be closer to the minimum.\n",
    "- C. the accuracy of 80.0 may be related to the shape of the loss function (where the minimum is located) so trying with a different one may increase the accuracy, also introducing a Regularization term to the update equation may make the model generalize better when unseen data is provided.\n",
    "- D. No, it is not. looking at the last 3 outcomes, we can see that the model has reached a steady state, so more than 20 epochs were not required in this case. So, in order to search for a better result, one solution may be making big steps at the beginning (big Lr) and then small steps that avoid the model keeps jumping a possible better minimum value for the cost function.\n"
